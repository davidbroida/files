Welcome to Snack or Booze documentation file. Get started by installing the proper tools to run/ use the app and explore all of its features.
Start up the app by running "npm install"in the terminal to install the dependencies and then npm start to start up the server. The backend is available at http://localhost:5000/. 

If you have issues getting the app to run this way try adding a .env file to the application's main directory and save with SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true saved inside of it.

Snack or Booze is a single-page web application for a dive cafe in Silicon Valley built with ReactJS and React Router. The app requires no authentication so users can run the app and begin using it immediately without any need to sign up or log in. Once inside of the app, users are able to view snacks, drinks and details about each menu item along with adding a drink of their own to the bar's drink menu!

Enjoy!
